    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>
        I started playing chess in 2020, I really enjoy playing games with a clock.
        I often play online games or play with friends over a real board.
        I have progressed quite a lot scince my beginings, but now I feel like I need to learn more to progress.
        An important part of chess lie in the openings, so players create openings notebooks to learn openings and be prepared for every oponent move.

        The process of creating an opening repertoire is fastidious, and things can get out of hand very fast.
        I figured out a very good way to visualize chess openings was to use a tree view.
        This way it is easier to register a lot of moves and then explore a specific part.

        I have created a proof of concept web application using Flutter and Dart.
        Then I decided to open source the application as I would like some more advanced Flutter developers to improve it.

        I have a lot of ambitions, and I think this project could become a powerful tool, for intermediate but also professional players.
        I have read a part of Tony Buzan's work on the memory and I think bringing mind maps and other memory techniques to chess could revolutionize the way players learn and digest positions and strategies.
