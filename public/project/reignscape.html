<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>ReignScape is an original and unique strategy / citybuilder game. It is also multiplayer so players can explore and build worlds together.</p>

<p>It is made with GodotEngine, using C#. The server was first written in C, but I decided to rewrite it in C#.</p>

<p>Alongside the development, I regularly published devlog videos on my Youtube channel Quantum Code. In those videos I show the progress made and share the behind the scenes of independent game development.</p>
