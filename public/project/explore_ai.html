<h2>Introcution</h2>
<p>
    Explore AI started as a school project. During the course, Kohonen maps were introduced to us.
    As I was curious about and wanted to learn more I asked to work on this subject, the teacher gave me an example that I could explore about images color space compression.
    This is how Explore AI started.
</p>
<p>
    As I was happy with the visualizations and found them intuitive, I decided to work on some educative Youtube videos.
    I created the Explore AI series, teaching artificial intelligence principles using visualizations made with Godot Engine.
    The series covers neural networks, backpropagation (as a supervised learning example) and unsupervised learning with Kmeans and Kohonen maps.
</p>

<h2>Neural Networks</h2>
<p>
Starting from the perceptron:

<P>I explain step by step how a neural network is formed and how it can achieve to solve non-linear problems. </P>

<h2>Backpropagation</h2>
<p>
    I explain the principle of backpropagation. I detail formulas, on a perceptron and then on a full neural network.
    I then give examples and use cases both in classification and regression.
</p>

<p>Here is an exaple of regressions to approximate some logical operators:</p>

<h2>Unsupervised Learning</h2>
<p>
    Unsupervised learning uses machine learning to analyze and cluster unlabeled datasets. The goal is to find hidden patterns or groupings.
</p>

<h3>Image color reduction problem</h3>

<p>
    Let's consider a 50×50 pixels image. Each pixel's color is encoded on 3bytes, this represents 256×256×256 (=more than 16 millions) different possible colors.
    Of course our image (2,500 pixels) does not need all those colors, so we can try to reduce the amount of colors used.
    A naïve approach would be to select colors spread around the visible spectrum, this can work if we keep a high number of colors.
    But as we select fewer colors, a lot of our selected colors will not be used in the image and we will end up with an image that does not make scence anymore.
    Another approach would be to take random colors among the ones in our image.
    This would surely result in better results but would still produce bad images as some specific colors would often not be randomly selected.
</p>

<p>
    A great solution to solve this problem is of course to use unsupervised learning.
    We consider the colors in our image as an unlabeled dataset.
    Using unsupervised machine learning we will try to create clusters.
    Those clusters will represent the most "important" colors in the image. 
</p>

<h3>KMeans algorithm</h3>

<p>Using the KMeans algorithm (detailed in the video) we can achieve some impressive results. Here is an example with a 50×50 pixels image represented using only 25 colors.</p>

<p>But because we use random intializations, it sometimes happens to get less impressive results.</p>

<p>As you can see we still recognize the image, but the colors are not great.</p>

<p>Note that some Kmeans initializations techniques exists but I decided not to explore this part, and create my own initialization as detailed below.</p>

<h3>Kohonen maps</h3>

<p>
    Another unsupervised learning technique is called Kohonen maps.
    I really enjoy working with this technique because I think it is an intuitive algorithm, and the visualizations are awesome.
