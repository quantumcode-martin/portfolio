<h2>Introcution</h2>
<p>
    Explore AI started as a school project. During the course, Kohonen maps were introduced to us.
    As I was curious about and wanted to learn more I asked to work on this subject, the teacher gave me an example that I could explore about images color space compression.
    This is how Explore AI started.

<p>
    As I was happy with the visualizations and found them intuitive, I decided to work on some educative Youtube videos.
    I created the Explore AI series, teaching artificial intelligence principles using visualizations made with Godot Engine.
    The series covers neural networks, backpropagation (as a supervised learning example) and unsupervised learning with Kmeans and Kohonen maps.

<h2>Neural Networks</h2>

Starting from the perceptron:

<P>I explain step by step how a neural network is formed and how it can achieve to solve non-linear problems. </P>
