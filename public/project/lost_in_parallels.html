    <h2>The Godot Fire Jam</h2>
    <p>
        Lost In Parallels is a 3 weeks game project made with Godot for the <a href="https://itch.io/jam/godot-fire-charity-jam-1">Godot Fire Charity Jam</a>.
        Lost In Parallels won the first place, received a lot of positive feedbacks and a cashprice of $568.
    </p>

        The theme of the jam was "Everything Changes". Lost In Parallels is a multiverse platformer in which the player can explroe parallel universes using a flashlight.
        The world representation and physics are changin in real time depending on the flashlight position.

    <p>Here is a behind the scenes of the game jam:</p>

    <h2>A Level Editor</h2>
    <p>
        After the game jam's results I felt the game had a lot of potential so I decided to create a level editor.
        This level editor was needed because the levels are interdependent and it makes the process of creating and modifying levels tiresome and time consuming.

    <p>
        As part of this level editor, I created a quite complex algorithm to compute the collision polygons for each layers and levels.
        This algorithm took me a full week of work to finish as a lot of spcific cases were to be taken into consideration.
        It is now fully functional and you can see an example here, with the collision polygons displayed using various colors:

        For more details about the level editor, feel free to watch the video I produced,
        I talk about this specific level editor but also in general why it may be a good idea for indie developers to create their own level editor.
