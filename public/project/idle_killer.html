    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>
        IdleKiller is an idle game made with Godot Engine.
        It puts you in the shoes of a citizen living under a tyrannical government.
        Your job is to elimiate people. But you will soon discover that you may be able to change the course of events
    </p>
    <p>
        This game was made in collaboration with a friend and collegue. It is currently in closed alpha testing on Google Play Store.
        We have around 50 testors and we have collected some user data and feedbacks to improve the game and make it ready for release. 
    </p>
    <p>
        The alpha version was made in only 3 mounths, and we made a resource oriented system so we can add and modify content very easely.
        This system could even be used to create other idle games super fast. 
    </p>

    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>My work on this project is very versatile as I not only work on the game core and the art but I have also created a server to collect user data and link our Ko-fi shop with the Discord server.</p>
    <h3>Game Core</h3>
    <p>
        I wanted something robust and reliable to be able to create lots of content with a minimum effort.
        So I decided to create a resource oriented system. Almost everything is a resource, each upgrade, each weapon, each character are defined by some custom resources.
        This allows anyone to create some game content without the need to understand nor write code. <br>
        This system took quite some time and effort to create, but now even a novice can create weeks on gameplay content within hours.

    <h3>Closed alpha registering</h3>
    <p>
        We needed around 50 players to test the closed alpha. In order to manage the access, I created an apache server with a database.
        This allows us to register join requests and manage the access precisely. The registering is done through an online form available <a href="https://quantumcode.company/idle_killer/join_alpha/">here</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
        We received more than 100 requests and accepted a bit more than 50, this allowed us to collect user feedbacks and record issues way faster.
        We also collected some user data which will be useful to balance the game.
    </p>

    <h3>Feedback collecting</h3>
    <p>
        I made an in-app feedback form so users can send us reports very easely.
        When a user sends a feedback to us, it goes through a php proxy hosted on our server and it uses the Trello API to create a card with everything we need.

    <h3>User Data: Collecting and Visualizing</h3>
    <p>
        We regularely collect timed data about the user's progress while the app is running. This data is written in a CSV file.
        When a users send reports, it also sends their user data, so we can access it from our feedback board.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        Then, to visualize and analyze this data, I made an interactive viewer using Python. With this tool, we can explore our user datas and learn a lot from it.

    <h3>Ko-fi shop: dynamic Discord role attribution</h3>
    <p>We have opened a Ko-fi shop so people can contribute financially, to help us finish the game, and they receive exclusive rewards.</p>
    <img src="https://quantumcode.company/images/idle_killer/kofi_shop.png" alt="A report card visualized inside Trello">
    
    <p>
        Amongst the rewards we offer, there are some special Discord roles on the game's Discord Server. Unfortunately Ko-fi does not offer support for this kind of rewarding with shop items yet.
        So I decided to make the automation on my own. Using Webhooks and the redirection offered by Ko-fi on purchase, I made it possible for clients to connect to Discord, using a Discord Bot and the Discord API via Curl requests.
        Finally the user is redirected to the Discord Server and the roles are attributed automaticaly.
    </p>
    
    <h3>Godot Dev Console</h3>
    <p>In order to make the developement, debuging and balancing of the game easier, I created a console inside the game. Of course it is not available on production builds, as it allows the user to cheat.</p>
    
    <img src="https://quantumcode.company/images/idle_killer/in_game_console.png" alt="A report card visualized inside Trello">
    
    <p>It has a help command that gives all the available commands and can also give details about a specific command.</p>


    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>
        I have put a lot of efforts and intensive work on this project during the few mounths of development.
        On the Godot side, I think I made huge progress around game data definition using custom resources.
    </p>
    <p>
        But the most valuable aspect of this project is how versatile my work has been.
        I have not only worked on the game core, but also created an entire server and website to make sure all the services were functional and well linked.
        This work gave me a consequent insight on how to develop and assemble parts of a project so they work together and result in a complete solution.
