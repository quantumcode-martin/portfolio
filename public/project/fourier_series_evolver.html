    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>
        This project is an experiment. The goal is to evolve visual fourier series through a genetic algorithm based on the user's choices.
    </p>

    <h2>Visualize Fourier Series</h2>
    
    <p>
        A complex Fourier series can be represented using the exponential form. Thus each frequency factor is defined by it's coefficient. Those coefficients are defined by an amplitude and a phase.
        
        So it is possible to represent a fourier series in the complex plan by placing chained circles, shifted by the phase, sized by the amplitude and moving relatively to each other at a speed defined by the frequency factor.

    <h2>Evolve Fourier Series</h2>
    
    <p>
        As explained, fourier series are defined by the amplitudes and phases of each frequency. A fourier genome is therefore defined by an ensemble of frequencies and their respective amplitudes and phases.
        Selection
        
        The selection is made by the user, there is a board of 6 series, where one can pick one as favorite. The board then shows new series from the population. Once every genome from the population has been shown, there will be POPULATION_SIZE/6 selected genomes, they will be the ones used by the genetic algorithm to build the next generation.
    </p>
    <h3>Mutation</h3>
    
    <p>
        There are different types of mutations. The first type adds a new frequency to the fourier series. It will add a frequency next to the ones already in the given series and set its amplitude and phase randomly.
        
        The second type is a frequency and phase modifier.
    </p>
    <h3>Breeding</h3>
    
    <p>The breeding is done by computing the mean on the amplitudes and phases of the parents on each frequency. If a frequency is only in one of the parents, the child will have the frequency and the same values as the parent.</p>
    
    <h2>Coming Next ?</h2>
    
    <p>
        With this first experiment, it was possible to see the effect of selection on the fourier series. By doing some wise selection, it is possible to end up with a population featuring individuals that share a common visual characteristic. As an example, you can try to draw some tiny fishes.
        
    </p>
    
    <p>But it still has some limitations, and could be improved to draw more complex shapes, by experimenting and trying different methods for the genetic algorithm.</p>
        
    <p>The difficult part will be to find a way (if there is one) to evolve the Fourier's coefficients without changing too much the shape. Because right now things are quickly getting out of hand !</p>
        
    <p>I have open sourced this project because I think it is pomising but needs some trial to improve.</p>
